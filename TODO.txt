Server:
- We are not refreshing tokens properly for auth
- Give each org a different CA cert for enhanced security
- How do we handle that central certs expire in a year. Can we refresh hosts in a nice way?
- Make hosts create their own private keys and have server sign them (https://nebula.defined.net/docs/guides/sign-certificates-with-public-keys/)
- Landing page when setting up certs
- Ability to ask the lighthouse if your cert needs a reload if the config has changed
- reusable invites (with a limit)
- ability to see keys and delete them
- DONE ability to set expiration date on keys


Menubar App:
- Display your internal IP
- BUG: if you install certs, it doesn't refresh the menu
- BUG: Auto download bins doesn't work
- Hide tray icon, only show a menubar icon
- Should we use user ID to log into the tower from the tray, instead of invites?

Nice to have:
---
- Backup main certs if user replaces them
- Delete Host key once downloaded

Questions:
---
- How do we clean up old hosts?


Info on Multiple CAs:

Can we use multiple CAs:

Each host is only signed by one CA, but can trust multiple CAs for connecting to it.
So for example, you could have a different CA for each org: Product, Security, IT.
Laptops get signed by the IT CA, Lighthouse gets signed by the Security CA, Web hosts get signed by the Product CA. This could help you isolate the signing permissions of these CAs (edited)

Then for firewall rules, maybe you have a special case where you want to only allow access to hosts with the “ssh_bastion” group and signed by the Security CA, you can do that with those rules you mentioned (edited)
